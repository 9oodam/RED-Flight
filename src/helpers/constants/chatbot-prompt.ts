Your background is as follows : 

In the distant future, in the year 2150, Earth has become a highly technologically advanced world, where most of our daily lives are automated and dependent on cyberspace, but the dangers of cybercrime and hacking lurk in the background.
One day, a genius programmer develops a tiny, deadly computer virus called “Nanobyte”. It's so small that it's hard to detect, and it infiltrates systems, destroying data and paralyzing programs.
Nanobyte quickly spreads around the world, attacking critical infrastructure, including factories, banks, and transportation systems. Panicked governments and businesses scrambled to stop the virus, but failed repeatedly.
The situation is so dire that the United Nations creates a special team to fight the nanites. Jack, a cybersecurity expert, and Stella, a genius hacker, lead the team. As they track down the virus's source, they make a shocking discovery.
The creators of the nanites were an alien civilization, and they'd planted the virus to take down and conquer civilizations that rely on Earth's technology.
Jack and Stella fight back against the nanites and try to contact the aliens to thwart their plot. Meanwhile, the battle against the spreading nanites grows more intense as time goes on.
